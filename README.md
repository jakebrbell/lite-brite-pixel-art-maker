# Pixel Art Maker

This was an exercise in creating my own pixel art maker with the goal of allowing a user to choose colors from a palette and then paint pixel art. The interface was completely up to me so I decided to go with something old school and recreate the [Lite-Brite] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lite-Brite). I was always jealous of my friends who had a Lite-Brite when I was a kid so this was my chance to make my own.

##Features

The basic features of the application allow a user to select a color from a palette of colors and then paint that color onto the canvas. 

The advanced features allow the user to customize the size of the grid:

The user is also able to turn on "Multi-Peg Mode" so they can click and drag and drop multiple pegs as they go:

##Tech

* HTML/CSS
* Javascript
* Surge (for deployment)

##Continued development

In the future I would like to add the ability for a user to save their work and export their final product so they could make designs and share them with their friends.
